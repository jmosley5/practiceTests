# Practice Tests
Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my practice playground. Feel free to look around and check it out for yourself!

# To Install and Run the tests, feel free to follow these instructions
1. To clone this repo into your local environment, open your terminal and copy and paste the following into your command line: `gh repo clone jmosley5/practiceTests`

2. To install the needed dependancies for this project, run `yarn install`

3. Open the code and create a new file called `cypress.env.json`. 

4. Copy the contents of `cypress.env.json.sample` and paste them into your newly created `cypress.env.json`. These variables are needed to run the tests successfully.

5. This project uses Cypress. To run the tests in headless mode, from your terminal run `yarn cypress run`

6. If you want to see the tests run using the UI, run `yarn cypress open`, select `E2E Testing`, select `Chrome` and click `practiceTests.cy.js`. The tests will run automatically from there. 

Have fun! ðŸŽ‰
